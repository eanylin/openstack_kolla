# OpenStack Kolla Ansible Hands-On Lab Session

This hands-on lab session will provide an overview of OpenStack Kolla and 
deployment using Ansible and Docker Containers.  Each participant will get 
a virtualbox image (Kolla All-In-One).  Docker images created via Kolla-Build 
will be included.  The OpenStack environment is CentOS based with OVS bridge 
and LVM Cinder.

The Virtualbox images for the lab session can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4s2vD6eSZllZlFTdU1QZ001eXc?usp=sharing)

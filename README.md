# OpenStack Kolla Ansible Hands-On Lab Session

This hands-on workshop is part of the Boston OpenStack Summit 2017. It 
will provide an overview of OpenStack Kolla and deployment using Ansible 
and Docker Containers. Each participant will get a virtualbox image 
(Kolla All-In-One). Docker images created via Kolla-Build will be included. 
The OpenStack environment is CentOS based with OVS bridge and LVM Cinder.

The Virtualbox images for the lab session can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4s2vD6eSZllZlFTdU1QZ001eXc?usp=sharing)

While we did not cover Kolla Kubernetes in the session, the Virtualbox images 
for Kolla Kubernetes can be found at the same link as well.

As discussed during the workshop, participants should refer to the ***Virtualbox
and Kolla VM Installation*** pdf file to restore Virtualbox images

Videos on multi-nodes deployment have been uploaded as well for reference.


The Hands-On Lab will proceed in the following order:

1. Validate Environment
2. Heat Stack Creation
3. Rebuild Environment
4. Logs
5. Multi-Nodes Cluster Demo
